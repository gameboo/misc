= Prepare the SD card

As a first step to booting a software ecosystem on the DE10Pro CHERI-BGAS setup,
we prepare a disk image to put on an SD card.

On a DE10Pro CHERI-BGAS system, we want a FreeBSD kernel to run on the ARM HPS system,
and a CheriBSD kernel for the RISCV FPGA soft-core.
We will use https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild.git[cheribuild] to prepare our environment.
Start by cloning cheribuild so you can build the various kernels and disk images described below. 

== Preparing the RISCV environment

At the time of writing, booting CheriBSD on our RISCV soft-core requires:
- a device tree binary for the RISCV soft-core system
- a build of BBL
- a build of CheriBSD with an embedded rootfs

=== Device Tree Binary for the RISCV soft-core system
https://github.com/gameboo/DE10Pro-softcore-devicetree.git

=== RISCV BBL
```
./cheribuild.py bbl-gfe-baremetal-riscv64-purecap
```

=== RISCV CheriBSD kernel with embedded rootfs
```
./cheribuild.py cheribsd-riscv64-purecap
./cheribuild.py disk-image-mfs-root-riscv64-purecap
./cheribuild.py --cheribsd-mfs-root-kernel/build-fpga-kernels cheribsd-mfs-root-kernel-riscv64-purecap
```

== Preparing the ARM HPS environment

=== Preparing relevant files for the FreeBSD rootfs
Extra files can be added to the final FreeBSD rootfs by placing them in
`<path to your cheri build source root, a.k.a. /home/gameboo/devstuff/cheri>/extra-files/\*`
**prior to running the command**. Here, we will want to add a `*.dtbo` device tree
overlay describing the FPGA hardware exposed to the HPS ARM system (RISCV debug unit, uart, interrupts...)
and a `/boot/loader.conf.local` configuration file to point to it, to enable the FreeBSD running on the ARM
HPS to interface with this hardware.

On the FreeBSD rootfs, we need:

- a FreeBSD rootfs ;)
- the RISCV environment from the previous section, i.e.
  * Device Tree Binary for the RISCV soft-core system
  * RISCV BBL
  * RISCV CheriBSD kernel with embedded rootfs
- a loader script `/boot/lua/loader.lua` to be included from the FreeBSD loader
  when booting FreeBSD
- to make the ARM HPS system FreeBSD instance able to communicate with the
  RISCV FPGA soft-core, we need it to detect the uart on the FPGA side. To do
  this, we need:
  * a device tree overlay `/boot/fpga-ns16550.dtbo`
  * a loader configuration `/boot/loader.conf.local` containing
    `fdt_overlays="/boot/fpga-ns16550.dtbo"`
- possibly your ssh keys to help ssh-ing into the ARM HPS system
- optionally, in `/etc/rc.conf` add
```sh
ifconfig_<interface name, a.k.a. dwc0>="inet <ip for the ARM HPS system, e.g. 192.168.10.10/24>"
defaultrouter="<ip of a host machine to act as a router, e.g. 192.168.10.1>"
```
- optionally, in `/etc/resolv.conf` add
```sh
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
```
- a clone of https://github.com/bukinr/RISCV_gdbstub.git to enable gdb sessions
  to the RISCV FPGA soft-core
- a clone of https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/fmem.git to interact with the
  various fmem devices from the command line
- git / vim / gcc / whatever tools...


=== FreeBSD arm kernel and disk image
by running:
```sh
./cheribuild.py --source-root=<path to your cheri build source root, a.k.a. /home/gameboo/devstuff/cheri> --freebsd/repository=https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/freebsd-morello --freebsd/git-revision=stratix10 --freebsd/toolchain=system-llvm freebsd-aarch64 disk-image-freebsd-aarch64
```

Once the cheribuild command is done, a `<path to your cheri build source root, a.k.a. /home/gameboo/devstuff/cheri>/output/freebsd-aarch64.img` disk image should be available. This image can be flashed onto an SD card by running (most likely as `root` for access to the SD card device):
```sh
dd if=<path to your cheri build source root, a.k.a. /home/gameboo/devstuff/cheri>/output/freebsd-aarch64.img of=<<path to your SD card device, a.k.a. /dev/sdX> bs=4M
```

You can then mount the FAT partition from the SD card and copy files to it easily.

== FAT partition

To enable later steps, the FAT partition on the SD card should contain:

- the `*.core.rbf` FPGA image to use for the FPGA configuration
- a u-boot binary image `u-boot.img`
- the `*.dtb` device tree binary used by the ARM HPS system
- the `*.efi` bsd loader
- the (fmem-enabled, with https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/freebsd-morello/blob/stratix10/sys/arm64/intel/fmem.c[this] driver) FreeBSD kernel to boot

=== Build and embed a u-boot bootloader, and get an hps and a core slice from a bitfile

You can build u-boot by running https://raw.githubusercontent.com/POETSII/DE10Pro-hps-ubuntu-sdcard-scripts/0f671c7726ab2b65011ed5632b7eb2d96cef9c80/build_uboot.sh[this] script.
Once the script is finished, relative to where it was ran, there should exist both a
`./u-boot-socfpga/u-boot.img` u-boot image and a
`./u-boot-socfpga/spl/u-boot-spl-dtb.ihex` first stage memory image.

`./u-boot-socfpga/u-boot.img` should be copied to th FAT partition on the SD card.
The first stage memory image `./u-boot-socfpga/spl/u-boot-spl-dtb.ihex` should be embedded in the startix 10 FPGA configuration.
### TODO: this assumes a built DE10Pro-cheri-bgas sof file. Add explanations...###
```sh
BOOTLOADER=<path to u-boot-socfpga>/spl/u-boot-spl-dtb.ihex
SOF=<path to your stratix 10 *.sof file>
OUTNAME=socfpga
quartus_pfg -c $SOF -o hps=ON -o hps_path=$BOOTLOADER $OUTNAME.rbf
```

= Prepare the RISCV FPGA soft-core system

== Push the hps rbf slice to the board and get a usb terminal going

From the host machine driving the DE10pro board:

```sh
RBF=<path to your stratix 10 *.hps.rbf file>
quartus_pgm -m jtag -o P\;$RBF@2 && picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

== Push the core rbf slice from the sdcard to the FPGA and setup the AXI bridges

From the u-boot prompt on the ARM HPS system:

```uboot
fatload mmc 0:1 1000 <FAT partition path to your stratix 10 *.core.rbf file>
fpga load 0 1000 ${filesize}
bridge enable
```

=== side note - other useful u-boot commands:

```uboot
printenv
usb start
usb info
fatload usb ...
```

= Boot FreeBSD on the ARM HPS system

== Get to the BSD loader

From the u-boot prompt on the ARM HPS system:

```uboot
fatload mmc 0:1 0x2000000 <FAT partition path to your *.efi FreeBSD loader file>
fatload mmc 0:1 0x8000000 <FAT partition path to your *.dtb device tree file>
bootefi 0x2000000 0x8000000
```

== Actually boot FreeBSD

From the FreeBSD loader prompt:

```bsdloader
load <disk0s1>:</path/to/kernel>
set currdev=<disk0s2:>
include <ROOTFS path to loader script, e.g. /boot/lua/loader.lua>
boot
```

=== side note - other useful FreeBSD loader commands:

Misc:

```bsdloader
show
fdt ls
```

To specify the usb drive as the rootfs on FreeBSD boot:

```sh
ufs:diskid/DISK-20090815198100000s2a
```

= Get a FreeBSD prompt on the RISCV FPGA soft-core system

== Get a GDB session to the RISCV FPGA soft-core

Once FreeBSD is booted on the ARM HPS system:

- Run RISCV gdb stub from an ARM HPS system FreeBSD prompt. RISCV gdb stub can
  be cloned from https://github.com/bukinr/RISCV_gdbstub.git and built simply
  using `make`.
- Once a RISCV gdb stub session is running on the ARM HPS system, connect a
  riscv gdb session. This should be done from a machine which has access to:
  * a RISCV bbl bootloader
  * a RISCV FreeBSD kernel
  * a device tree for the RISCV FPGA soft-core system (see
    https://github.com/gameboo/DE10Pro-softcore-devicetree.git)
  Typically, you would run on the same host machine driving the DE10Pro board
  `gdb-multiarch <path to RISCV bbl>` (running gdb-multiarch wih a riscv binary
  as argument will ensure a riscv-gdb session) and connect to the RISCV gdb
  stub running (on port 81) on the ARM HPS system with `target remote <DE10Pro
  board ip or hostname>:81`

== Boot the RISCV FPGA soft-core system

From the gdb session to the RISCV FPGA soft-core:

- load the RISCV system's device tree (the one generated from
  https://github.com/gameboo/DE10Pro-softcore-devicetree.git is wrapped in an
  elf container which will load at address `0x80000000`):
  `load <path to the elf container for the RISCV system's device tree>`
- load the RISCV FreeBSD kernel: `load <path to the RISCV FreeBSD kernel>`
- load the bbl bootloader: `load`
- set the `a0` and `a1` argument registers to bbl with the hart id and device
  tree address respectively:
  * `set $a0 = 0`
  * `set $a1 = <device tree load address, e.g. 0x80000000>`
- send the RISCV core running: `continue`

== Connect a prompt to the RISCV FPGA soft-core system UART

From an ARM FreeBSD prompt, connect to the uart using `cu -l /dev/ttyu0` (this
`/dev/ttyu0` device should have been detected by virtue of having booted the
ARM FreeBSD kernel with the previously mentioned device tree overlay).
